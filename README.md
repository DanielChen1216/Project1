## Notes & shoutouts

I made a tons of research from youtube, google, and it really costed me alot of time to get familliar with ember, such like connection between HTML, CSS, JS. What does controller, components, template do, how to install boostrap ect... After few hours researching, I think I'm getting more and more familliar.
